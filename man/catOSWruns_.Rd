\arguments{
\item{sqMass_files}{An array of character paths to the chromatograms that have corresponding names in the OSW file.}

\item{in_osw}{A character vector of the absolute path and filename of the osw file. (Must be .osw format)}

\item{which_m_score}{A character vector indicating which m_score to use. (Options: m_score or ms2-m_score. Default: 'm_score')}

\item{m_score_filter}{A numeric vector indicating the threshold m_score cut-off value for filtering. (Defualt: 0.05)}

\item{report_top_single_result}{A logical value indificating to keep only the results with the lowest m_score. (Default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
A data.table containing Run ID information
}
